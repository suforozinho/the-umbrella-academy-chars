    description: 'Luther Hargreeves, originally known as Number One and best known as Spaceboy, is the leader of the Umbrella Academy and twin brother to Number Five. He is codenamed Spaceboy due to his accomplishment of being the youngest person ever to become an astronaut. It is unsure as to whether Luther\'s codename was chosen by himself, Hargreeves or the media, as a poster of "Spaceboy – The first boy in space" is shown in The Umbrella Academy: Apocalypse Suite.'

    description: 'Diego Hargreeves, originally designated Number Two and best known as the Kraken, is the reckless and rebellious member of the group; described by Monocle as “an insolent brat.” He has the ability to hold his breath indefinitely and has demonstrated a strong affinity for knife-throwing. He and Luther have a very clear rivalry, and Diego seems unwilling to take orders from Luther. He is more of a Batman-like superhero in that he goes on regular patrols and can be seen taking down drug dealers. In his teenage years, he was the bass player in a band called the Prime-8s, with Body (Inspector Lupo\'s assistant), and Vanya Hargreeves. He is also seen to be left handed in the short story "Anywhere But Here," as he is playing the bass left handed. It appears that he harbors a secret soft spot for his adopted sister, Vanya. It is yet to be seen how The Kraken lost his right eye and wears an eye-patch when not wearing his mask, which has it blacked out.'

    description: 'Allison Hargreeves, codenamed The Rumor, has the power of reality manipulation through lying. If she says anything that is not true then reality will adjust so that it is. She wears a black and red outfit with her logo, the letter R and a question mark merged together. She married and had a daughter, but was divorced and her husband got full custody of their daughter. She and Spaceboy are known to have feelings for each other. However, it seems evident that she may be abusing her power on Spaceboy to help cope with her divorce.'

    description: 'Klaus Hargreeves, originally labeled as Number Four and best known as the Séance, is one of the forty-three superpowered babies with several great abilities. These powers include telekinesis,  communicating with the dead (mostly through ouija boards), channeling the dead, communicating through airwaves, possessing people, immortality and levitation. He could easily become an unstoppable force of nature to save humanity on a number of occasions, but his heavy drinking and frequent drug usage make him much less powerful. He rejoined the Umbrella Academy in 1980 to stop the apocalypse and had fought with his brothers in the Vietnam War. He is the only member of the Academy to have died and come back to life.'

    description: 'Number Five (no other birth name known or used) was one of the forty-three children born at once, and one of the seven adopted by Sir Reginald Hargreeves. He is a member of the Umbrella Academy with the ability to travel through time. At the age of ten, Five traveled twenty years into the future and found himself in an apocalyptic wasteland, forcing him to spend decades trying to travel back to 1960, time which slowly drove him insane. When he finally traveled back, he was captured and "modified" by the surgeons of the Temps Aeternalis, who mixed strands of DNA of serial killers and Five\'s, making him the perfect killer with a 100% success rate, and taught him how to perform microjumps in time, thus making him incredibly fast.'

There is a memorial statue of him located in the front of the Academy. Even though he\'s been dead since before the start of the series (but after the Murder Magician affair), he\'s been portrayed as a member of The Umbrella Academy since ever, appearing as his statue counterpart, or as images of him alive.'

She is considered among her siblings to be the youngest one. Unlike her brothers and sister, Vanya apparently has no power and is a common girl that, according to her father, can barely play the violin. However, this was a lie fabricated by Hargreeves to keep her power in check, as, in reality she is the most powerful of them all. Upon learning the truth, Vanya went insane and took up the mantle of the White Violin to end the world with her abilities, but when she regained control became broken and devastated by what she had become.'

He adopts the members of The Umbrella Academy at birth. Inventor of the Televator, the Levitator, the Mobile Umbrella Communicator, and Clever Crisp Cereal. Olympic gold medalist for fencing, and recipient of the Nobel Prize for his work in the cerebral advancement of the chimpanzee. He was very cold in his raising of the children in that he refused to let the children call him father, instead preferring to be called The Monocle. Also when speaking to the children he addressed them by their number, which he gave them in order of usefulness to him, in his opinion.'
